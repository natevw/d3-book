This is the [start](http://n.exts.ch/2013/04/new_d3_book) of a D3.js book that [didn't happen](http://n.exts.ch/2013/08/status). I may/may not start on the more interesting chapters (maps, apps) at some point if the whimsy ever strikes.

You're welcome to [ask questions](https://github.com/natevw/d3-book/issues) on any of the material (present or missing) and I could add that to the contents as well.
